Full body tracking is cool. 

Why? Better yet, what?
======
Full body tracking refers to the VR technology that tracks each individual
limb, and their respective movement. The aim for full body tracking is to gain
a more filling experience within virtual realities. Although full body tracking
is often paired with VR, there are other uses for it such as remote control
over dangerous situations.
